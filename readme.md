# Mage Helper

This is a firefox extension to help use the mage.space site/webapp.

_This is an unofficial firefox helper._

What it does:

Hides all the "apps" on the left side.
It was implemented because several users asked for it.

This does not do anything function.
It only hides the "Select Model" button on the build page and brightens
the currently displayed selected model.

## Future

Support exporting and importing configurations.

Export a creation, including prompt, metadata and model.
